Here's my philosophy
Livin' in a penitentiary
Brothers all on the corner
Tryin' to make believe
Turn around ain't got no pot to pee
Make me mad when I see ya sad
Can't stand to see ya hustle doin' bad
But you can't win when your will is weak
When you're knocked on the ground

Evil, don't you test me
Evil, you won't win

Oh why world
Why world
Do want me to be so mad yeah
So mad yeah
Oh why world
Why world
Do you want me to be so mad yeah
So mad yeah

I'm tellin' you the truth
I hope I'm not being too cruel
Since you ain't playing by the rules
I'm 'bout to kick you off your stool

Evil, don't you test me
Evil, you won't win

Oh why world
Why world
Do want me to be so mad yeah
So mad yeah
Oh why world
Why world
Do you want me to be so mad yeah
So mad yeah

I am a warrior princess
I have come from the other sun
Gather all of your members
Unite them as one
Move together in harmony
Build a bridge
Now destroy a bridge
Eliminate your weakness
Conquer evil, the demon
And live forever together

Oh why can't we get along and
Take all the funky tones
And make up a funky song
That be bangin' on and on
Make me mad when I see ya sad
With the same look ya momma had
But ya can't win when your will is weak
But ya get out ya seat
Oh why Why Why world
Do you want me to be so mad
So mad yeah
Why in the world
Why world do you want me to be so mad yeah

Ooh, hey
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
Think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere
Ooh, hey
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
Think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere

Didn't cha know, didn't cha know
Tried to move but I lost my way
Didn't cha know, didn't cha know
Stopped to watch my emotions sway
Didn't cha know, didn't cha know
Knew the toll but I would not pay
Didn't cha know, didn't cha know
'Cause you never know where the cards may lay

Time to save the world
Where in the world is all the time?
So many things I still don't know
So many times I've changed my mind
Guess I was born to make mistakes
But I ain't scared to take the weight
So when I stumble off the path
I know my heart will guide me back

Ooh, hey
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
Think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere
Ooh, hey, ooh
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
I think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere

Didn't cha know, didn't cha know
Tried to run but I lost my way
Didn't cha know, didn't cha know
Stopped to watch my emotions sway
Didn't cha know, didn't cha know
Knew the toll but I would not pay
Didn't cha know, didn't cha know
I said ya never know how the cards may lay

Love is life, and life is free
Take a ride of life with me
Free your mind and find your way
There will be a brighter day
Love is life, and life is free
Take a ride of life with me
Free your mind and find your way
There will be a brighter day
Love is life, and life is free
Take a ride of life with me
Free your mind and find your way
There will be a brighter day

I was standing downtown, downtown
Staring at the puddles on the ground
Tryin' to figure out a way up out of this town
And I know yeah, I'm not the only one
So many people out there chase the sun
If you're looking for a free ride
You better run child
Or you sure won't get too far, oh
You'd better dance a dance
To make the rain come down
If you want to be a star, oh, my life

My life (Brother you know)
Sure ain't been too easy
My life (Sister you know)
The life I wanna live
My life (Mama you know)
You're gonna go through changes
My life (I'm tellin' you no)
No turnin' back

Every now and then I
Wanna throw my hands up in the sky
Cause one day I know I'll be flyin' high
And I know yeah I got to get down
On my knees and pray
Cause in heart I know I'll see that day

When my freedom comes along
I'm gonna run child
Cause I know that I'll go far
Can't let nobody kill my soul and bring me down
And they know who they are, my life

My Life (Brother you know)
Sure ain't been too easy
My life (Sister you know)
The life I wanna live
My life (Mama you know)
You're gonna go through changes
My life (I'm tellin' you no)
No turnin' back

My life (Brother you know)
Sure ain't been too easy
My life (Sister you know)
The life I wanna live
My life (Mama you know)
You're gonna go through changes
My life (I'm tellin' you no)
No turnin' back

On & on & on & on
Wake the fuck up 'cause it's been too long
Say, wait a minute, Queen, what's your name?
See, I be that gypsy flippin' life game from the right brain (huh)
Ascension maintained
Rolling through like a burning flame
Like a supernova star
She be the light when they in the dark
Morning
The moon pass the sun
Four constellations start forming
A cross up in the sky
But everybody wanna ask me why

What good do your words do if they can't understand you?
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu
What good do your words do if they can't understand you?
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu

Said I'm a Pisces
Zika deka del
Well, well, I'm raising hell
People always tryin' to find the world I'm in
I'm the envy of the women and I rule the men
Two fish, one swimmin' up stream
One swimmin' down livin' in a dream
But when she loves she tends to cling
When incense burns, smoke unfurls
Analog girl in a digital world
The Rasta style flower child
Zip dip dow, zip dip dow
The gold tooth smile
Split them vowels
Bling bloom bling, melanated
I'm 'bout ta give birth to church
But everybody want to ask this Earth
What...

What good do your words do if they can't understand you?
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu
What good do your words do if they can't understand you?
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu
Bridge!

I remember when I went
With Momma to the Washateria
Remember how I felt the day
I first started my period
Remember there in school one day
I learned I was inferior
Water in my cereal
Badu in your stereo
Holla if you hear me though
Remembering is good if you don't
Let it be the fear in you
Wrap ya head with this material (Material)
Cause you did not do your math
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
Mad props to the God JaBorn

Things just ain't the same for singers
Gotta sing on the beats they bring us
But that's all I have, ain't got no mo'
But still the people really wanna to know

What good do your words do if they can't understand you?
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu
What good do your words do if they can't understand you?
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu

This is how I look without makeup
And with no bra my ninny's sag down low
My hair ain't never hung down to my shoulders
And it might not grow
You never know

But I'm clever when I bust a rhyme
I'm cleva always on ya mind
She's cleva and I really wanna grow
But why come you're the last to know?

I got a little pot in my belly
So now a days my figure ain't so fly
My dress ain't cost nothin' but seven dollars
But I made it fly
And I'll tell you why

But I'm clever when I bust a rhyme
I'm cleva always on ya mind
She's cleva and I really wanna grow
But why come I'm the last to know?

Alright alright alright
Alright alright alright
Alright alright alright
Alright alright alright yeah

It's too late
It's too late
It's too late, yeah
Come on, babe

Don't you wanna be strong with me?
You told me we could have a family
Wanna run to mama when you're down and low
But times get tough, and there you go
Ooh, out the door, you wanna run again
Open the arms and you'll come back in
Wanna run 'cause you say that you were afraid, afraid, oh

Never knew what a friendship was
Never knew how to really love
You can't be what I need you to
And I don't know why I fuck with you

I know our love will never be the same
But I can't stand these growing pains
